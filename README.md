# dev-config

Configuration and helpers for building a NixOS VM
running on Apple Silicon Macs as a single purpose,
pre-configured, predictable development environment.

Shamelessly copied and altered from 
[nixos-config](https://github.com/mitchellh/nixos-config)
created by Mitchell Hashimoto.

For some demos and the thinking behind it, watch the 
[Dev Tool Time with Mitchell Hashimoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA8KF9Fs2sk)
podcast episode.
